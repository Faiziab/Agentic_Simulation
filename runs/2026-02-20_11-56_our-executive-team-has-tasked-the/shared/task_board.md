# Task Board — R&D Initiative

## Original Prompt
Our executive team has tasked the R&D department with producing an internal research study on the following question: How can AI agents be strategically utilized within a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) platform and its surrounding workflows?
CTEM operates as a five-stage program  Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization. We need to understand where AI agents create genuine leverage across these stages, where they introduce unacceptable risk, and what a realistic adoption path looks like for a mid-sized cybersecurity vendor operating in this space.
This is an exploratory study, not a build directive. I expect the research track to ground our thinking in what AI agents can actually do today versus what is speculative. I expect the engineering track to assess build complexity, data dependencies, and failure modes for the most promising use cases. I expect the product track to evaluate market differentiation  what competitors like Tenable, XM Cyber, Cymulate, and Pentera are already doing, and where we have a genuine opening. All tracks should challenge each other's assumptions. The final output should reflect honest disagreement where it exists, not forced consensus.


## VP's Strategic Decomposition
## Thinking

The Board has presented a critical strategic initiative: to understand how AI agents can be leveraged within our CTEM platform. This is an exploratory study, not a build directive, which means our primary goal is to gather comprehensive intelligence on feasibility, market potential, and inherent risks. My role is to decompose this overarching question into actionable, distinct objectives for Research, Engineering, and Product, ensuring their work is complementary and fosters constructive challenge.

I need to ensure each department's objective directly addresses a core aspect of the Board's request, while also emphasizing cross-functional collaboration. For Dr. Okafor's Research team, the focus must be on the *'what can AI agents actually do today'* and their inherent limitations. Maya's Engineering team will assess the *'how'* – the build complexity, data needs, and failure modes for the most promising use cases. Alex's Product team will tackle the *'why'* – market differentiation, competitive landscape, and customer value.

A key element from the Board's directive is to allow for "honest disagreement." My structure should facilitate this by creating clear hand-offs and dependencies where each team's insights build upon, and potentially challenge, the others. I will also incorporate my personal quirks: emphasize risk identification, frame decisions by impact, and ensure clear takeaways.

## Action

Team,

We've received a significant strategic initiative from the Board: an exploratory study on "How AI agents can be strategically utilized within a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) platform and its surrounding workflows." This isn't about building something immediately, but about deeply understanding where AI agents offer genuine leverage, where they introduce unacceptable risk, and what a realistic adoption path looks like for a mid-sized cybersecurity vendor like us.

This study demands a holistic view, integrating technical reality with market opportunity. I expect each of you and your teams to challenge assumptions robustly and ensure our final output reflects a balanced, well-informed perspective, even if it highlights areas of honest disagreement.

My biggest question for all of us as we embark on this: **What's the biggest risk we're not seeing as we explore this space?** Keep this front of mind.

Here are the initial objectives and tasks for each of your departments:

---

### **1. Research Department (Dr. James Okafor)**

**Objective:** To provide a foundational understanding of current AI agent capabilities, their limitations, and potential applications within each CTEM stage, identifying areas of genuine leverage and inherent technical risks. This track grounds our thinking in what's *actually* possible today versus what remains speculative.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Capability & Landscape Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive literature review and landscape analysis of current AI agent technologies, focusing on their capabilities for automation, reasoning, data analysis, and decision support specifically within cybersecurity contexts.
2.  **CTEM Use Case Mapping:** Map identified AI agent capabilities to each of the five CTEM stages (Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization), proposing specific, technically feasible use cases where AI agents could provide genuine leverage.
3.  **Technical Risk Assessment:** For each proposed use case, identify potential technical limitations, failure modes, and inherent risks that AI agents could introduce (e.g., hallucination, data poisoning, adversarial attacks, ethical concerns, explainability issues).

**Deliverables:**

*   A categorized report detailing current AI agent capabilities, their state of maturity, and identified technical limitations relevant to CTEM.
*   A structured document outlining potential AI agent use cases across the 5 CTEM stages, including a preliminary assessment of technical feasibility and associated inherent risks.

**Cross-Department Dependencies:**

*   **Engineering:** Will need to consult with Engineering to validate technical assumptions on current platform capabilities and potential integration points for proposed use cases.
*   **Product:** Will need to align with Product on initial understanding of CTEM workflows and potential areas of market interest to focus research efforts.

### **2. Engineering Department (Maya Rodriguez)**

**Objective:** To technically evaluate the feasibility, complexity, and resource requirements for implementing the most promising AI agent use cases within a CTEM platform, identifying critical data dependencies and potential failure modes from an engineering perspective. Your analysis will inform our 'impact vs. effort' assessment.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Use Case Selection & Deep Dive:** Collaborate closely with Research and Product to select the top 3-5 most promising and impactful AI agent use cases across CTEM stages for detailed engineering assessment.
2.  **Technical Feasibility & Architecture Review:** For each selected use case, conduct a preliminary architectural review to identify core data dependencies (types, volume, access), required infrastructure, integration points within our existing platform, and estimated build complexity (e.g., person-hours, specialized skills, third-party dependencies).
3.  **Failure Mode & Scalability Analysis:** Analyze potential engineering failure modes, scalability challenges, and operational requirements (e.g., monitoring, maintenance, performance tuning) for the selected use cases, proposing initial mitigation strategies.

**Deliverables:**

*   A technical feasibility report for the top 3-5 AI agent use cases, detailing architectural considerations, data requirements, estimated engineering effort, and integration challenges.
*   An analysis of critical engineering failure modes, scalability concerns, and proposed mitigation strategies for each assessed use case.

**Cross-Department Dependencies:**

*   **Research:** Heavily dependent on Research's initial assessment of technically viable AI agent capabilities and use cases.
*   **Product:** Dependent on Product's insights into market demand and competitive differentiation to help prioritize which use cases are 'most promising' from a business standpoint.
