# Research Department Output

**Lead:** Dr. James Okafor

## Thinking

I have thoroughly reviewed the initial submissions from Dr. Priya Sharma and Tom Park. Both have demonstrated a commendable grasp of the assigned objectives and have articulated structured, methodical approaches to their respective tasks. My primary focus now is to provide specific guidance where clarifying questions were raised, affirm the robustness of their plans, and then synthesize these departmental efforts into a consolidated report for Dr. Chen, emphasizing our current position, anticipated findings, and inherent dependencies.

Dr. Sharma's plan is exceptionally detailed and rigorous, aligning precisely with the methodological standards I expect. Her proposed frameworks for source validation, technical deep dives, TRL classification, and comprehensive risk categorization are particularly strong. The granularity of her cross-departmental requests indicates a proactive understanding of the critical inputs required for a robust analysis.

Tom's enthusiasm is evident, and his proposed steps for literature review and risk compilation are sound for the foundational phase. His clarifying questions are prudent for a junior researcher, indicating a desire for precision, which I appreciate. I must provide clear, concise answers to these to ensure his work seamlessly feeds into Dr. Sharma's refinement phase.

Regarding cross-departmental insights, it is worth noting that we have not yet received direct *responses* from Alex Kim (Product) or Maya Rodriguez (Engineering). However, Dr. Sharma's detailed requests *to* them represent our current understanding of the critical information required from those departments. This proactive identification of dependencies is vital for managing project timelines and ensuring the comprehensiveness of our eventual findings.

My synthesis for the VP will emphasize the department's strong methodological foundation, highlight the critical dependencies on other departments, and proactively outline potential risks and areas of concern from a research perspective.

## Action

First, I shall address the clarifying questions raised by Tom Park, ensuring he has the precise directives needed to commence his foundational work.

### Feedback to Tom Park

Tom,

Thank you for your prompt response and for articulating your proposed approach with such clarity. Your enthusiasm for this strategic initiative is very much appreciated, and your understanding of the tasks aligns well with my expectations. Let me address your clarifying questions to ensure optimal alignment for your deliverables:

#### Regarding Task 1: Initial Capability & Landscape Analysis (Phase 1)
*   **Preferred High-Level Structure:** For the "preliminary Categorized Report draft," I recommend a structure that first introduces the overarching categories of AI agent types (e.g., LLM-based, Reinforcement Learning, Hybrid Multi-Agent Systems) and then, within each category, details their core capabilities. Subsequently, it would be beneficial to present the identified cybersecurity applications, followed by demonstrated performance metrics (where available), key technical principles, and any readily apparent limitations. This structure should provide a logical flow for Dr. Sharma's subsequent refinement.
*   **Preferred Citation Style:** For consistency across our technical documentation, please adhere to the **IEEE citation style**. This is standard practice in our R&D division.
*   **Depth for Initial Phase:** Your outlined approach is indeed sufficient for this initial phase. The objective here is broad coverage and accurate categorization to lay the groundwork. Dr. Sharma will then conduct the deeper dives into mechanisms, performance benchmarks, and TRL classification.

#### Regarding Task 2: Support for CTEM Use Case Mapping
*   **Effective Way to Provide Support:** You should coordinate directly with Dr. Sharma. I would suggest scheduling regular bi-weekly check-ins with her to consolidate notes, discuss emerging insights from your literature review, and assist in populating any documentation templates she develops. Proactive communication will be key here.
*   **Depth for Initial Support Phase:** Your anticipatory steps—familiarizing yourself with CTEM stages and compiling a terminology glossary—are excellent and precisely the kind of proactive support Dr. Sharma will find valuable. Continue with this preparatory work.

#### Regarding Task 3: Baseline Risk Compilation
*   **Level of Detail for Descriptions & Examples:** For the "Compendium of Generic AI Agent Risks," please provide concise yet comprehensive descriptions. For the examples, strive to find instances that, while perhaps not directly proven in an agent *within a cybersecurity context*, demonstrate a *clear potential impact* or analogous failure mode that could manifest in such a domain. This will make the compendium immediately more relevant for Dr. Sharma's targeted risk assessment.
*   **Depth for Initial Compilation:** Your outlined approach for this baseline compilation is sufficient. The goal is a comprehensive inventory of generic risks. Dr. Sharma will then analyze these risks in the specific context of the proposed CTEM use cases.

Thank you again, Tom. Please proceed with these clarifications in mind. I anticipate your initial report and risk compendium will provide a robust foundation for our departmental analysis.

### Review of Dr. Priya Sharma's Plan

Dr. Sharma,

I have thoroughly reviewed your detailed methodological plan for the "Refinement of Capability & Landscape Analysis," "CTEM Use Case Mapping," and "Technical Risk Assessment." I must commend you on the intellectual rigor and systematic approach embedded within your proposed strategy. It is precisely what is required for an exploratory study of this magnitude.

Your emphasis on **Source Validation & Credibility Assessment**, prioritizing peer-reviewed literature and reputable industry standards, is paramount and aligns perfectly with our commitment to evidence-based research. The intention to conduct a **Mechanism & Performance Deep Dive** for promising architectures, coupled with a **Maturity Level Classification** using a TRL-like framework, will provide the necessary nuance to differentiate between theoretical potential and current practical applicability. This is a critical distinction that the Board explicitly requested.

Your approach to **CTEM Use Case Mapping**, involving granular workflow deconstruction and systematic capability-to-workflow matching, demonstrates a profound understanding of how to bridge theoretical AI capabilities with practical application in our domain. The articulation of problem statements, leveraged capabilities, and expected technical outcomes for each use case will be invaluable.

Furthermore, the comprehensive **Technical Risk Assessment** framework you propose, expanding upon Tom's baseline, is robust. The inclusion of algorithmic, data, operational, and ethical/compliance risks, along with the intention to quantify impact and likelihood where possible, provides a strong foundation for identifying and mitigating potential pitfalls. Your proactive outlining of mitigation strategies is particularly astute.

Your articulated **Collaborative Strategy** with Tom, Alex, and Maya is also well-considered, ensuring a cohesive and integrated departmental effort.

In summary, your plan is comprehensive, addresses all specified deliverables and constraints, and incorporates the necessary methodological rigor. I have no improvements to suggest for your current plan; it is exemplary.
