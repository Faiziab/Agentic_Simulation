  "prompt": "Our executive team has tasked the R&D department with producing an internal research study on the following question: How can AI agents be strategically utilized within a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) platform and its surrounding workflows?\nCTEM operates as a five-stage program  Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization. We need to understand where AI agents create genuine leverage across these stages, where they introduce unacceptable risk, and what a realistic adoption path looks like for a mid-sized cybersecurity vendor operating in this space.\nThis is an exploratory study, not a build directive. I expect the research track to ground our thinking in what AI agents can actually do today versus what is speculative. I expect the engineering track to assess build complexity, data dependencies, and failure modes for the most promising use cases. I expect the product track to evaluate market differentiation  what competitors like Tenable, XM Cyber, Cymulate, and Pentera are already doing, and where we have a genuine opening. All tracks should challenge each other's assumptions. The final output should reflect honest disagreement where it exists, not forced consensus.\n",
