  "prompt": "The R&D department has been tasked with conducting an internal research study on the following question: How can AI agents be strategically useful, and where do they become genuinely dangerous?\nThis is an exploratory study, not a build directive. The research track should ground the team's thinking in what AI agents can demonstrably do today versus what remains speculative \u2014 covering capability boundaries, autonomy levels, and decision-making reliability. The engineering track should assess the technical realities of deploying AI agents \u2014 where they perform reliably, where they break, what failure modes look like, and what conditions make them unsafe to operate. The product track should examine the broader landscape \u2014 where AI agents are creating real value across industries today, where adoption has backfired, and how the risk-benefit calculus is evolving. All tracks should actively challenge each other's assumptions. Where genuine disagreement exists, it should surface and be documented \u2014 not resolved into false consensus.",
