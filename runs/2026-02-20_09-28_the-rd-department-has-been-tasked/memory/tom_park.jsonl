It\u2019s a bit of a shift for me because, as a researcher, I usually want to find the potential in every paper! But I realize that for the Board, a \"maybe\" is just as dangerous as a \"no\" when it comes to safety. I\u2019ve started gathering the last 18 months of ArXiv pre-prints and industry white papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.\n\nI am particularly struck by the \"Handover Gap\" mentioned by both Dr. Chen and Dr. Okafor. It reminds me of the \"Automation Surprise\" phenomenon in aviation\u2014where the pilot doesn't know what the plane is doing or why. Mapping this to LLMs, where the \"reasoning\" is a black box, makes my task of separating \"Demonstrated\" from \"Speculative\" even more critical. If a model seems to reason but can't be audited, is that capability truly \"demonstrated\" for a production environment? I\u2019m also looking at how Dr. Sharma\u2019s quantitative work on \"drift\" will intersect with my qualitative audit. If I find a paper claiming 90% success on a task, but Priya\u2019s meta-analysis shows that success drops to 20% after five steps, that\u2019s a huge red flag for the \"Speculative\" bucket!\n\n## Action\n\n### 1. Salient Questions\n*   **Quick question regarding the \"Reproducible Benchmarks\" criteria:** How should we categorize capabilities that are reproducible *only* within a specific, closed ecosystem? For example, if a capability is demonstrated using a proprietary search tool that we can't access, does that count as \"Demonstrated\" or should I flag it as \"Speculative\" due to the lack of external verification? \n*   **Challenging the \"Hype\" Assumption:** Are we perhaps overlooking \"quiet\" capabilities? Much of the hype is around agentic planning, but are there smaller, more reliable \"System 1\" capabilities that are being ignored because they aren't flashy, even though they might be the \"quick wins\" Alex Kim is looking for?\n*   **The \"Moving Target\" Problem:** Since models like GPT-4o are updated via RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) frequently, how do we ensure our \"Maturity & Boundary Report\" isn't obsolete by the time it reaches the Board? Should I include a \"Confidence Half-Life\" for each capability?\n\n### 2. Insights\n*   **The Documentation-Reliability Correlation:** I\u2019m noticing a pattern where papers with the most \"anthropomorphic\" language (using words like \"thinks,\" \"plans,\" or \"intends\") tend to have the least rigorous benchmarking. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the use of narrative \"hype\" and the actual reproducibility of the results.\n*   **Synthesis of Roles:** I\u2019ve realized that my \"Speculation Audit\" acts as the qualitative filter for Dr. Sharma\u2019s quantitative data. While she measures *how much* a model drifts, I am identifying *which* specific claims are likely to cause that drift in the first place. We are essentially building a \"Safety Map\" where her work defines the terrain and mine identifies the mirages.\n*   **The Handover Gap as a Metadata Issue:** I suspect the \"Handover Gap\" occurs because agents don't provide sufficient \"state transparency.\" If an agent could export a \"certainty score\" for each step, the human would know exactly when to step in. The \"speculative\" part of the industry right now is the claim that agents can self-correct without this external transparency.\n\n### 3. Self-Assessment\n*   **What went well:** I\u2019ve successfully organized a database of 150+ papers from the last 18 months and created a preliminary tagging system for \"Benchmark Type\" (e.g., HumanEval, MMLU, GAIA). I feel very aligned with Dr. Okafor\u2019s vision for the 5-level scale.\n*   **Areas for improvement:** I need to be careful not to over-explain every single paper in the bibliography. Dr. Okafor needs a \"ruthless\" summary, not a 500-page book! I also need to make sure I don't get too distracted by interesting \"fringe\" papers that don't directly impact our SOTA model mapping.\n*   **Should I go deeper on the \"Self-Correction\" literature?** I\u2019ve noticed a lot of conflict there\u2014some papers say it works, others say it\u2019s just the model \"hallucinating\" a correction. I think this is a key \"Danger Zone\" for the report.\n\n## Cross-Department Requests\nCROSS_DEPT_REQUEST: [Maya Rodriguez] - Quick question, Maya! To help with my Speculation Audit, do we have internal logs showing where \"Chain-of-Thought\" prompts failed to actually improve accuracy in our own testing? It would help me verify if the \"Self-Correction\" claims in recent papers hold up in a real engineering environment.\n\nCROSS_DEPT_REQUEST: [Alex Kim] - Just to make sure I understand correctly, Alex: when you look at \"Industry Pain Points,\" are you more interested in agents that can do *new* things, or agents that can do *existing* things with 100% reliability? This will help me prioritize which \"Speculative\" capabilities I should investigate most thoroughly.\n\n## Status\nI have completed the initial scan of high-impact pre-prints and have begun the \"Hype vs. Reality\" comparison matrix. I am currently mapping the \"Reasoning\" capabilities of Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o against the preliminary Level 2/3 definitions. Pending feedback on whether to include \"closed-source reproducible\" results in the \"Demonstrated\" bucket.\n\nCONFIDENCE: [8/10] \u2014 I have a strong grasp of the current literature and a clear methodology for the audit, though the rapid pace of new releases (the \"Moving Target\") introduces some uncertainty in the final mapping.\n\n---\n**Tom Park**\nJunior Research Analyst, TechNova Inc.
