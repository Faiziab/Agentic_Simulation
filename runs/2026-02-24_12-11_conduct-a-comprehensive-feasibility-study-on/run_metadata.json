  "prompt": "Conduct a comprehensive feasibility study on building an autonomous AI agent specifically designed to assist Presales Engineers at a global cybersecurity distributor. 1. Market Analysis: Use web search to analyze current market solutions and competitors in the AI presales or cybersecurity copilot space. 2. Technical Architecture: The Engineering and Product teams must design a specific architectural pattern (e.g., multi-agent orchestration, RAG for vendor spec sheets, secure data enclaves) to support this. 3. Methodology & Reasoning: The final executive synthesis must explicitly document the R&D department's step-by-step methodology. Detail exactly how the team approached the research, the reasoning behind the chosen technical architecture, and the justification for the proposed product features.",
