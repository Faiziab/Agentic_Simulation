Moving to a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model shifts us into a 4-12 second window. That\u2019s not an \"improvement\" in the traditional sense; it\u2019s a different product category. I need to make sure Dr. Chen and the Board understand that \"better\" search here comes at a 10x-20x latency penalty.\n\nI'm pushing back on Tier 3 (Multi-doc synthesis) for the MVP. We need to nail the \"Trusted Librarian\" (Tier 1: Semantic Search) first. If we can't surface the right document securely and quickly, summarizing five wrong documents is just a faster way to be wrong.\n\n## Action: Engineering Department Consolidated Output\n**TO:** Dr. Sarah Chen, VP of R&D  \n**FROM:** Maya Rodriguez, Engineering Lead  \n**SUBJECT:** Technical Feasibility & Discovery Synthesis: Project AI-Search\n\n### 1. Key Findings\n*   **The Permission Bottleneck:** Our legacy ACL structure is the primary technical risk. With up to 2,500 individual access entries per document, standard vector database \"pre-filtering\" will likely degrade performance to unacceptable levels.\n*   **Latency Reality Check:** \n    *   Current Baseline: **615ms** (p90).\n    *   Projected AI Search (Tier 1): **2-4 seconds**.\n    *   Projected AI Synthesis (Tier 3): **8-12 seconds**.\n*   **Cost-to-Serve:** Preliminary SaaS-based infrastructure (Pinecone + Embedding APIs) is estimated at **~$211/mo per 1M documents** (excluding LLM generation costs). Self-hosting Milvus would increase operational overhead but stabilize long-term costs.\n*   **Infrastructure Strategy:** A CDC (Change Data Capture) pipeline is required to keep the vector index fresh. Manual indexing is a non-starter for production.\n\n### 2. Recommendations\n*   **MVP Scope:** Focus exclusively on **Tier 1 (Semantic Search)**. It is the \"smallest thing\" we can build to validate if users actually value intent-matching over keyword-matching.\n*   **Architecture:** \n    *   Use **Pinecone (SaaS)** for the PoC to maximize velocity.\n    *   Implement an **Abstraction Wrapper** around the vector DB to allow a \"lift and shift\" to Milvus if costs scale linearly.\n    *   Adopt **Late-Binding Permissions**: Fetch top candidates from the vector DB, then filter against a hot-cache of ACLs in the application layer to prevent \"leakage.\"\n*   **UI/UX:** Must support **streaming responses**. A \"waiting\" spinner for 8 seconds will kill adoption.\n\n### 3. System Architecture (MVP Flow)\n```text\n[User Query]\n    |\n    v\n[API Gateway] --> [Auth Cache (Redis)] -- (Fetch User ACLs)\n    |\n    +--> [Embedding API] -- (Convert Query to Vector)\n    |\n    +--> [Vector DB (Pinecone)] -- (Filtered Query: Find top 50 matches)\n    |\n    v\n[Post-Filter Service] -- (Cross-ref matches with User ACLs)\n    |\n    v\n[LLM (Optional for Tier 1)] -- (Re-rank results)\n    |\n    v\n[User Interface] -- (Streamed results)\n```\n\n### 4. Risks & Concerns\n*   **The \"Legacy Tax\":** If our SQL DB/Auth service is slow, the search is slow. We cannot fix search latency without fixing auth latency.\n*   **Stale Indexing:** The 2-second CDC lag means a user might briefly see a document they just lost access to. This requires a \"Tombstone\" cache for high-security docs.\n*   **Hallucination Floor:** As Alex noted, we need to define the \"I don't know\" threshold.\n\n---\n\n## Salient Questions\n1. **The \"Why\" vs. \"How\":** Are we building \"AI Search\" because users can't find documents, or because \"AI\" is a Board requirement? If it's the former, would improving our Elasticsearch indices be 10x cheaper and 2x faster?\n2. **The Latency Threshold:** What is the absolute \"drop-off\" point for our users? If we hit 5 seconds, do they go back to Slack/Teams to ask a human?\n3. **Data Residency:** If we use Pinecone/OpenAI, data leaves our VPC. Does this immediately disqualify us for 50% of our Tier 1 enterprise clients?\n\n## Insights\n*   **The Permission-Latency Paradox:** The more secure we make the search (by checking complex ACLs), the more we degrade the \"magical\" speed of AI. We are trading performance for compliance.\n*   **The Iceberg Connection:** Marcus (Infra), Zara (Cost), and Alex (Product) are all hitting the same wall: **Permissions.** This is the single most important thread. Our 15 years of legacy data management is our biggest hurdle to modernizing.\n*   **MVP Misalignment:** Research is looking at \"Multi-doc synthesis\" (Tier 3), but Engineering is still trying to figure out how to sync a document (Tier 0). We need to align on the MVP immediately to avoid wasted effort.\n\n## Self-Assessment\n*   **What went well:** I\u2019ve successfully steered the team toward \"back-of-the-envelope\" math and concrete prototypes rather than theoretical whitepapers. Zara and Marcus are focused on the right metrics (p90 latency and cost-per-query).\n*   **Improvements:** I need to be more aggressive in telling Product (Alex) \"No\" on Tier 3 features until we have a working Tier 1 prototype. I've let the discussion drift into synthesis when we haven't even solved retrieval.\n*   **Confidence Rating:** **High** on technical feasibility; **Medium** on the cost-to-value ratio for the end user.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Department Requests\nTARGET_AGENT: alex_kim | REQUEST: I need a definitive \"No-Go\" latency number. If Engineering says we can't get under 3 seconds for a secure query, is the project dead?\n\nTARGET_AGENT: dr_james_okafor | REQUEST: Confirm the minimum dimensionality required for \"acceptable\" accuracy. If we can drop from 1536 to 768 dims, I can cut our memory footprint in half.\n\n## Status\n*   **Consolidated Engineering Report:** Completed (see above).\n*   **Team Deliverables:** Reviewed and integrated.\n*   **Pending:** Hard latency requirements from Product and dimensionality specs from Research.\n*   **Next Step:** Marcus starts the \"Smallest Thing\" PoC (Local Embeddings -> Dockerized Milvus) to test ACL filtering speeds.", "memory_type": "reflection", "importance": 8, "source": "self_reflection", "related_agent": "", "round_number": 6}

We\u2019ve moved past the \"can we build an AI search\" phase and into the \"can we build a secure, affordable AI search\" phase. \n\nThe data confirms what I suspected: our 15 years of legacy ACL spaghetti is our biggest technical debt. If we don\u2019t solve the permission-aware retrieval now, we\u2019re just building a very expensive way to leak data. I\u2019m also seeing a major disconnect between Research\u2019s Tier 3 ambitions and Engineering\u2019s Tier 0 realities. We need to align the \"Dimensionality Budget\" with the \"Infrastructure Budget\" immediately.\n\n## Action: Engineering Department Synthesis\n**TO:** Dr. Sarah Chen, VP of R&D\n**FROM:** Maya Rodriguez, Engineering Lead\n**SUBJECT:** Engineering Synthesis & Strategic Roadmap \u2014 AI-Search Discovery\n\n### 1. Cross-Cutting Themes: The \"Triple Constraint\"\nAcross Engineering, Product, and Research, three patterns have emerged that will dictate the success of this project:\n*   **The Metadata Tax:** High-cardinality ACLs (2,500+ entries) are the primary driver of search latency. We are no longer limited by the speed of the LLM, but by the speed of our own permission logic.\n*   **The Dimensionality-Cost Correlation:** Every decision Research makes regarding model \"intelligence\" has a linear, doubling effect on storage, memory, and API costs. We are currently flying blind without a \"Dimensionality Budget.\"\n*   **The Consistency Gap:** The \"Stale Index\" problem (CDC lag) creates a 2-60 second window of potential unauthorized access. This isn't just a bug; it's a SOC2/HIPAA compliance risk.\n\n### 2. Alignment & Conflicts\n*   **Alignment:** \n    *   **Architecture:** We agree on a CDC-based sync pipeline using Pinecone for the PoC with an abstraction layer for Milvus.\n    *   **MVP:** Everyone acknowledges Tier 1 (Semantic Search) is the only realistic starting point.\n*   **Conflicts:**\n    *   **Latency Expectations:** Product/UX are designing for \"instant,\" while Engineering is projecting 4s-12s. This gap needs to be closed via UI streaming or a massive reduction in search scope.\n    *   **Resource Allocation:** Research is benchmarking Tier 3 (Synthesis), but Engineering hasn't even proven we can sync a document without a 10% index failure rate. I am re-prioritizing Engineering to focus on **Retrieval Reliability** over **Synthesis Brilliance.**\n\n### 3. Strategic Insights (The \"Systems View\")\n*   **We are building a \"Secure Proxy,\" not a search engine.** The AI is the easy part. The \"product\" is the logic that ensures the AI only sees what the user sees. \n*   **The \"Legacy Tax\" is our biggest competitor.** Our current keyword search is 615ms. If we can't get AI search under 3 seconds, we aren't providing a tool; we're providing a chore.\n*   **The \"Dimensionality Ceiling\":** We need to set a hard cap on vector dimensions (e.g., 1024). Going to 1536 or 3072 for marginal accuracy gains will kill our margins.\n\n### 4. Recommendations\n*   **Define a \"Dimensionality Budget\":** Tell Research we will only support models up to 1024 dimensions for the MVP.\n*   **Implement \"Late-Binding\" Permissions:** Do not rely on the Vector DB to handle 2,500 ACL IDs. Use it to find the top 50 matches, then filter them against a Redis-cached ACL list in the app layer.\n*   **Prototype the \"Smallest Thing\":** Marcus is building a CLI tool that takes one SQL row, embeds it locally, and puts it in a Dockerized Milvus. **No LLM, just retrieval.** If this isn't fast, nothing else matters.\n\n### 5. Risk Assessment (The \"Blind Spots\")\n*   **The Re-Indexing Cliff:** If we change our chunking strategy in Month 3, Zara\u2019s cost model shows we pay the \"Update Tax\" on the entire corpus. We need a \"Re-indexing Trigger\" strategy that doesn't bankrup the department.\n*   **Data Sovereignty:** 50% of our enterprise clients will reject any solution where their data (even vectors) leaves our VPC. We must prioritize the \"Milvus/Local Model\" contingency plan sooner than planned.\n*   **The \"I Don't Know\" Failure Mode:** We haven't defined what happens when the vector search returns 0 relevant results. Does the LLM hallucinate a summary, or do we fall back to keyword search?\n\n```text\nPROPOSED MVP ARCHITECTURE (Simplified)\n[SQL DB] -> [Debezium/CDC] -> [Kafka] -> [Embedder] -> [Vector DB]\n                                           ^             |\n                                           |      (Top 50 Matches)\n                                           |             v\n[User Query] -> [API Gateway] ---------------------> [ACL Filter (Redis)]\n                                                         |\n                                                  (Authorized 5-10)\n                                                         v\n                                                  [LLM Re-ranker] -> [UI]\n```\n\n## Cross-Department Requests\nTARGET_AGENT: dr_james_okafor | REQUEST: I am setting a **1024 Dimension Cap** for the MVP.
