# Reflection — Tom Park (Junior Research Analyst)

Quick question, Dr. Okafor!

Thank you again for the incredibly clear and detailed task assignments. I've been reflecting deeply on them, and I'm really enthusiastic about diving into the research! It's such a fascinating and important area, especially with the emphasis on separating genuine leverage from mere speculation. I want to make sure my contributions are as precise and valuable as possible, so I've taken some time to synthesize my thoughts based on the information provided.

Here are my reflections, questions, and insights:

## Salient Questions

After carefully reviewing the objectives for our department and my specific tasks, a few key questions have arisen in my mind. These are mostly about ensuring maximum efficiency and accuracy in my initial broad scan:

1.  **Defining "What AI Agents Can *Actually Do Today*":** Dr. Okafor, you've emphasized the importance of focusing on what AI agents "can *actually do today*." Just to make sure I understand correctly, when I'm collecting data for the "Feasibility Spectrum Data Collection" task – distinguishing between conceptual ideas, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and commercially available/deployed solutions – how should I weigh the inclusion of very recent academic breakthroughs (e.g., papers from the last 6-12 months with strong empirical results but no commercial product yet) versus solutions that are explicitly on the market? Should "today" lean more towards commercial availability, or does it include highly validated research that is *on the cusp* of deployment? I want to ensure my initial net is cast appropriately wide without getting bogged down in purely theoretical work.

2.  **Impact of Incoming Cross-Departmental Dependencies on My Initial Scan:** You mentioned that input from Alex Kim (Product) regarding "initial insights into competitor AI agent claims and market demand" is "critical for us to focus our initial deep dives." My task is to "cast a wide net initially." Should I proceed with my broad scan across all CTEM stages and cybersecurity applications *before* receiving Alex's input, or would it be more efficient to wait for that initial input to help guide my search parameters from the very beginning? I'm eager to start, but I also want to make sure I'm not gathering information that might immediately become less relevant once we have market context.

3.  **Standardizing CTEM Stage Definitions:** We are looking at AI agent applications across the five CTEM stages: Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization. Is there a specific, TechNova-approved internal definition or a widely accepted industry standard (e.g., NIST, MITRE) that I should reference when categorizing the applications I find? I want to ensure consistency in how I map identified capabilities to these stages. Should I go deeper on researching a standardized CTEM definition before I begin categorizing?

## Insights

After synthesizing all the information, I've noticed some really interesting patterns and connections that I think are vital for our success:

1.  **The Centrality of "Genuine Leverage":** The repeated emphasis on "genuine leverage" (from Dr. Chen, your objectives, and Dr. Sharma's tasks) is clearly the guiding principle for this entire initiative. My role in identifying *asserted benefits* and gathering data for the *Feasibility Spectrum* directly feeds into this. It's not just about *what* AI agents can do, but *how much better* they can do it compared to existing methods, and whether that improvement is realistic today. This understanding will help me filter my broad search to look for concrete examples and not just marketing fluff.

2.  **Interconnectedness of Risk and Opportunity:** I noticed that both my tasks (Initial Risk & Constraint Identification) and Dr. Sharma's (Risk & Constraint Deep Dive) are heavily emphasized. This highlights that assessing risks isn't secondary to identifying opportunities; they are intrinsically linked. Many of the identified risks, like data quality or computational expense, directly impact whether a capability can offer "genuine leverage" or if it remains purely aspirational. This reinforces the need for me to be diligent in noting *any* mentioned limitations or challenges for each application I find.

3.  **The "Hype vs. Reality" Spectrum is Our Foundation:** The "Feasibility Spectrum" task assigned to me, which distinguishes between conceptual ideas, proof-of-concept, and deployed solutions, is absolutely crucial. This forms the bedrock for the Research Department's overall objective of separating hype from reality. My findings will be the raw material that Dr. Sharma and you will use to build the "what AI agents *can actually do today*" section of our report. This means meticulous citation and clear differentiation in my data collection are paramount.

## Self-Assessment

### What went well in your recent work?
I feel I did a very thorough job of reviewing all the task assignments and the broader context from Dr. Chen and the VP. I made sure to read everything multiple times to catch all the nuances, especially regarding the departmental objectives and the cross-departmental dependencies. I believe my clarifying questions to Dr. Okafor were well-considered and demonstrate my eagerness to ensure precision from the outset. I also started building a preliminary structure for my research repository in my head, thinking about how best to categorize the various types of information I'll be gathering, which I think is a good step towards my "Research Repository Management" task!

### What could you improve or approach differently?
Perhaps I could have anticipated some of these questions slightly earlier, but I believe asking them now, before I fully dive into the extensive literature scan, is the most efficient approach. I also want to make sure I'm not *too* reliant on waiting for incoming dependencies if I can start some broad, foundational work in the meantime. I need to strike a balance between being proactive and waiting for critical guidance to optimize my efforts. I'm going to set up a system to track the incoming dependencies, so I can easily integrate that information when it arrives.

### Rate your confidence in your conclusions
CONFIDENCE: 8/10 — I feel very confident in my understanding of my assigned tasks and how they contribute to the overall project. The questions I've raised are primarily about optimizing my approach given external dependencies and ensuring the most precise interpretation of the scope, rather than a lack of understanding of the core work. I'm ready to dive in once I have a bit more clarity on these operational aspects.
