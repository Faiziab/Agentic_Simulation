# Reflection — Lena Voronova (UX Researcher)

## Thinking

Alex has given me a really exciting and important set of tasks. My role as the UX Researcher is to be the voice of our users, and for this strategic initiative, that means diving deep into their real-world struggles within CTEM and how they perceive AI agents. It's not about what *we think* they need, but what they *actually* need and what they *trust*.

My immediate focus is on preparing for those targeted customer interviews and setting up a clear framework for analyzing support tickets. The "Jobs To Be Done" lens is perfect for this, as it helps us look beyond superficial requests to the underlying motivations and desired outcomes. I need to ensure my interview questions are open-ended enough to uncover those unspoken needs and anxieties about AI in a cybersecurity context.

The market demand assessment will build directly on those qualitative insights. It's about validating whether the problems our customers highlight are also recognized as opportunities in the broader market, and if there's an appetite for AI solutions that address them. This requires a balanced perspective, not just jumping on the latest trend.

I'm also keeping in mind Alex's emphasis on "honest disagreement" and the risk of "over-promising AI capabilities." My findings must be grounded in user reality, even if it challenges some initial assumptions about where AI could be applied. Trust and control are going to be huge factors for our customers, especially in security.

## Action

### 1. Salient Questions

1.  **What does "AI agent" *actually* mean to our mid-sized enterprise customers in the context of CTEM?** Do they envision a fully autonomous entity, a smart assistant, or something else entirely? A user might say, "I want AI to just handle this vulnerability for me," but what level of human oversight do they expect or require? Understanding their mental models is crucial for designing trustworthy and usable solutions. This directly relates to Nielsen's heuristic of *user control and freedom* – they need to feel in charge, even if AI is assisting.
2.  **Where is the critical balance between AI automation and human oversight/control for our CTEM users?** In cybersecurity, the stakes are incredibly high. Our customers are likely wary of "black box" solutions. Are they looking for AI to automate mundane tasks to free up their time, or to make critical decisions? What are their comfort levels with AI taking action versus providing recommendations? We need to challenge the assumption that more automation is always better, especially if it sacrifices transparency or control.
3.  **What are the underlying psychological barriers (e.g., fear of job displacement, trust in autonomous systems, data privacy concerns) preventing mid-sized enterprises from embracing more AI in cybersecurity, even if it promises efficiency?** It's not always about technical capability; it's often about human perception and organizational culture. If a user says, "I don't trust it," we need to dig into *why* they don't trust it.

### 2. Insights

*   **Trust is the ultimate UX hurdle for AI in Cybersecurity:** Across all the discussions from Dr. Chen, Alex, and the potential concerns, the unspoken elephant in the room for our users is trust. It's not just about if the AI *can* do something, but if our customers *believe* it can do it reliably, securely, and transparently. My research needs to explicitly probe this, because without trust, even the most brilliant AI solution will gather dust. This ties into Nielsen's *visibility of system status* and *help and documentation* – users need to understand what the AI is doing and why.
*   **The "Jobs To Be Done" for AI are likely about augmentation, not replacement, for our target market:** Given our focus on mid-sized enterprises, their security teams are often lean and stretched. I suspect AI's biggest value will be in alleviating alert fatigue, prioritizing vast amounts of data, and automating repetitive, low-risk tasks, allowing human analysts to focus on complex, high-impact strategic work. It's about empowering them, not replacing them. This aligns with Alex's guidance to find where AI can be a "true hero" by solving existing struggles.
*   **The narrative around AI will be as important as the technology itself:** How we introduce, explain, and support AI agents will dictate market acceptance as much as their technical prowess. If we present AI as a partner, a force multiplier for their existing teams, that will resonate far better than positioning it as an all-knowing, hands-off solution. This is where the synthesis of my user research and Alex's competitive analysis will be vital – how are competitors framing their AI, and where can we tell a more compelling, human-centered story?

### 3. Self-Assessment

*   **What went well:** I feel very confident and aligned with the direction Alex has provided. The "Deep Dive into Customer Pain Points & Value Propositions" is precisely my forte, and using the "Jobs To Be Done" framework will ensure we uncover genuine needs. The emphasis on qualitative interviews first is the right approach to truly understand the human element behind CTEM challenges. I'm also well-equipped to analyze customer feedback channels effectively.
*   **What could I improve or approach differently:** While I'm great at qualitative research, I need to be meticulous in how I structure the interview guide to ensure I'm consistently capturing insights on both explicit CTEM pain points *and* nuanced perceptions of AI (excitement vs. concerns, trust levels, desired control). I also need to ensure I'm asking "why" repeatedly to get to the root causes, especially when discussing AI. For the market demand assessment, I'll need to actively seek out diverse market reports to avoid confirmation bias. I should also prepare a clear method for synthesizing direct user quotes and themes into the deliverables to make them highly impactful for Alex.
*   **Confidence in my conclusions:** My confidence in my *approach* to these tasks and my *ability* to deliver the expected insights is very high. My confidence in the *specific conclusions* about what users will say or what the market demands is moderate, as that's the nature of exploratory research – the findings will emerge from the data, not from assumptions.

CONFIDENCE: 8/10 — I'm confident in my plan and expertise to execute these tasks effectively and deliver valuable insights. The remaining 2 points reflect the inherent uncertainty of any exploratory user research before the data is actually gathered.
