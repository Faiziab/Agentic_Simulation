# Reflection — Zara Ahmed (Junior Software Engineer)

## Thinking

Okay, I've reviewed Maya's assignments for me and Marcus, and the overall directive. My tasks are clear: data requirements, quality, and privacy. I've got the deliverables in mind: data dependency matrix, data flow diagrams, and a report on quality/privacy issues, plus annotation estimates.

The big blocker is that I need "concrete AI agent applications" from Research to actually start. Maya already made the cross-department request for Dr. Okafor's input. Until then, I can't map data sources or assess specific quality needs.

I need to focus on what I *can* think about now, given the dependency, and what questions are still open.

## Action

### 1. Salient Questions

1.  **What level of detail will Research provide for "concrete AI agent applications"?** My tasks are specific, requiring identification of data types, volume, and velocity. If the applications are still too abstract, I'll need to push for more detail or make assumptions that would need validation.
2.  **How do we prioritize data quality and availability challenges if we find multiple critical gaps?** Maya stressed data is a huge risk. If several promising AI applications require data that is either low quality, unavailable, or difficult to acquire/annotate, we'll need a clear way to flag the most impactful issues.
3.  **What are the primary CTEM data owners I should prepare to engage with once Research provides the applications?** I need to know who to talk to about specific data sources, quality, and privacy implications when the time comes.

### 2. Insights

*   **Interdepartmental Dependency is Key:** My work, and Marcus's, is directly blocked by Research's output. This highlights how critical it is for teams to deliver their part for the whole project to move forward. Maya explicitly called this out, and it's definitely true from my perspective.
*   **Data is the Foundation for AI, not an Afterthought:** Maya's guidance and my specific tasks really emphasize that the AI model itself is only as good as the data it uses. Focusing on data quality, privacy, and availability upfront, even before building anything, is essential to avoid major problems later. This is a big learning for me.
*   **Exploratory means identifying problems, not solving them (yet):** This isn't a build phase. My goal is to find all the potential data headaches and risks for integrating AI, not to design the perfect data pipeline right now. It's about assessment and laying out the facts, even if they're inconvenient.

### 3. Self-Assessment

*   **What went well:** I quickly grasped my assigned tasks and understood the critical dependency on Research's output. I identified the scope of my work and the deliverables clearly. I'm ready to jump on it the moment I get the necessary information.
*   **What could I improve or approach differently:** My initial instinct is always to "spike on this real quick" and start prototyping or looking for solutions. For this exploratory phase, I need to exercise more patience and focus purely on the assessment and analysis, even when I'm itching to get hands-on. I also need to make sure I don't get sidetracked by general AI data concepts before I have the concrete use cases.
*   **Confidence in conclusions:** High. I understand my role and the current state of work, including the dependencies.

## Cross-Department Requests
None needed at this moment. Waiting for Dr. Okafor's team.

## Status
Understood assigned data dependency, quality, and privacy tasks for AI agent integration. Identified critical blockers and open questions. Ready to proceed once concrete AI agent applications are provided by Research.

CONFIDENCE: 8/10 — Confident in my understanding of the tasks and dependencies. The 2-point deduction is only because I can't actually *start* detailed work until Research delivers, so there's still a bit of uncertainty about the exact shape of that input.
