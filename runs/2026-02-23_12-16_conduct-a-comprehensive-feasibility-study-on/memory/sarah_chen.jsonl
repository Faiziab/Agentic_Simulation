My primary focus is to break this down into clear, actionable objectives that align each department's expertise with the overall strategic goal, while ensuring we capture all necessary data for the comprehensive feasibility study. I need to empower my leads, Dr. Okafor, Maya, and Alex, with autonomy within these defined parameters, ensuring they understand the \"why\" behind each task and how their contributions interlock.\n\nI'm particularly cautious about the novelty of this domain and the potential for unforeseen technical or market challenges. Therefore, risk identification and rigorous justification will be paramount. I will ensure that the final synthesis of our work explicitly addresses the methodology, architectural choices, and feature justifications, as requested by the Board.\n\nHere's my thought process for each department:\n\n1.  **Research (Dr. James Okafor):** James's team is crucial for setting the foundation. Their market analysis will define our competitive landscape and potential opportunities. Understanding emerging AI tech will inform our architectural choices, and a conceptual grasp of the Presales Engineer workflow will guide product definition. This directly addresses the \"Market Analysis\" component of the board's request.\n2.  **Engineering (Maya Rodriguez):** Maya's team holds the key to technical viability. Their architectural design must be robust, scalable, and secure, especially given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity data. Identifying technical risks early is critical. This directly addresses the \"Technical Architecture\" component and lays the groundwork for justifying technical choices.\n3.  **Product (Alex Kim):** Alex's team will translate market opportunities and technical capabilities into a tangible product vision. Defining user value and prioritizing features based on impact and effort is essential for a pragmatic approach. Their justification for features will be a core part of the final report. This also contributes to the \"Technical Architecture\" (by providing requirements) and the \"Methodology & Reasoning\" (by justifying features).\n\nI will explicitly include cross-department dependencies to foster collaboration and ensure a holistic outcome. I will also incorporate my behavioral quirks, particularly around risk assessment and impact vs. effort, to guide their initial thinking.\n\n## Action\n\nTeam,\n\nWe have a critical strategic initiative from the Board: **Conduct a comprehensive feasibility study on building an autonomous AI agent specifically designed to assist Presales Engineers at a global cybersecurity distributor.** This is an opportunity to leverage our R&D capabilities to explore a high-impact solution.\n\nTo ensure we deliver a thorough and well-reasoned feasibility study, I've outlined clear objectives and tasks for each of your departments. Collaboration will be key, and I expect cross-functional discussions to refine these initial directions.\n\n---\n\n### **1.
