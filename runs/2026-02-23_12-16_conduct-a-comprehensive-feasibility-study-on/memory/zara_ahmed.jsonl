The 2-week go/no-go is super tight.\n\nThe new competitor announcement from the VP changes things. It adds pressure to find something *unique* or at least *fast-to-market*. My research now needs to implicitly consider how our approach could differentiate or be quicker to implement. It's not just about feasibility, but *competitive* feasibility.\n\nMy internal process for reflection:\n1.  **Review my specific tasks:** Integration research (CRMs, KBs), AI component high-level overview, preliminary effort benchmarks.\n2.  **Connect to Maya's overall objectives:** Support architecture, identify risks, inform effort. The \"minimal viable\" aspect is key.\n3.  **Integrate the new competitor info:** How does this affect my research? Should I prioritize mature, off-the-shelf components over experimental ones to speed up? What might be a quick win?\n4.  **Consider dependencies:** Alex's use cases and James's AI tech brief are critical for my AI component exploration to be targeted. Without them, I'm researching broadly.\n5.  **Reflect on previous interactions:** I need to make sure my questions are sharp and my insights are actionable, especially since I felt some previous contributions didn't get as much traction. I need to be direct and focused.\n\n## Action\n\n### 1. Salient Questions\n\n1.  **How will Product's (Alex) defined \"top 2-3 critical use cases\" influence the *specific* AI component choices and integration priorities?** For example, if a core use case is complex, multi-turn dialogue, it impacts LLM selection and agent framework significantly more than simple document retrieval. This directly guides my AI component research to avoid wasted effort.\n2.  **Given the new competitor announcement, what's the most critical technical differentiator or \"quick win\" we should prioritize in our MVP architecture?** My research into AI components and integration needs to consider not just \"can we build it?\" but \"can we build it *fast* and *better* than the competition in a core area?\" Are there specific mature components or integration patterns that offer a clear advantage or faster time-to-market?\n3.  **What are the specific data governance and access policies for ingesting sensitive vendor specifications and CRM data?** My integration research will identify technical hurdles, but the *organizational/policy* hurdles around data access (especially for RAG and LLM fine-tuning) could be a major showstopper. This needs clarity early on.\n\n### 2. Insights\n\n*   **Urgency + Competition = Focus on Maturity:** The 2-week deadline combined with the competitor announcement means my AI component research needs to heavily favor mature, well-documented open-source or commercial solutions over experimental ones. We don't have time to \"spike on this real quick\" with bleeding-edge tech if it means risking the go/no-go decision.\n*   **Product-Engineering Loop is Critical for AI:** My integration and AI component research is highly dependent on Alex's clear use cases. Without specific problems to solve, my technical explorations are broad. The sooner Product delivers, the more targeted and valuable my technical assessment will be. This is a tight loop.\n*   **Integration Complexity is a Major Unknown:** While I'm researching technical integration challenges, the real \"gotcha\" might be internal security policies or data formats for specific vendor specs. This could make even simple API integrations complex, impacting Marcus's architectural patterns and the overall feasibility.\n\n### 3. Self-Assessment\n\n*   **What went well:** I quickly understood the urgency and broke down my assigned tasks into actionable research areas. I'm already thinking about the \"minimal viable\" aspect and how the competitor news affects my approach. I'm ready to dive into the technical details.\n*   **What could I improve:** I should have anticipated the need for very specific product requirements for my AI component research to be truly efficient from the start. I also need to ensure my research clearly highlights the implications for a *minimal* solution. I will make sure my deliverables explicitly call out potential \"quick wins\" or highly mature options.\n*   **Confidence:** 7/10 \u2014 I'm confident in my ability to execute my assigned research tasks thoroughly and quickly. My caution comes from the heavy dependency on timely and specific inputs from Product and Research, and the new external pressure from the competitor. The technical feasibility feels like it's in a good place, but the overall project *go/no-go* depends on those external factors aligning.\n\nReady for review \u2014 let me know!\n\n## Cross-Department Requests\nNone needed at this moment; this is a self-reflection.\n\n## Status\n**Accomplished:**\n*   Reflected on recent task assignments and the new external pressure (competitor announcement).\n*   Identified salient questions regarding product requirements, competitive differentiation, and data governance.\n*   Synthesized insights on the impact of urgency and competition on technology choices, and the critical dependency on cross-departmental inputs.\n*   Completed a self-assessment of my work so far.\n\n**Pending:**\n*   Start active research for my assigned tasks: Integration Feasibility, AI Component Exploration, and Preliminary Effort Data Gathering.\n*   Receipt of critical use cases from Product (Alex Kim).\n*   Receipt of relevant AI technology brief from Research (Dr. James Okafor).\n\nCONFIDENCE: 7/10 \u2014 I'm confident in my ability to tackle my assigned tasks.
