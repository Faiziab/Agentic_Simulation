# Reflection — Lena Voronova (UX Researcher)

## Thinking

Okay, this reflection is important, especially with the new information about the competitor. It's easy to get swept up in the urgent "do" mode, but taking a moment to pause and ask the deeper questions is crucial for steering us in the right direction. Alex's plan is solid for the short term, but the external pressure means we can't just find *any* pain points; we need to find the ones that lead to a truly differentiated and impactful solution. My caution from past experiences tells me I need to be extra clear and evidence-based in my findings to ensure they resonate.

I'm thinking about how my user interviews can not only uncover issues but also shed light on *why* those issues are so painful and what specific "Jobs To Be Done" are currently underserved, even by potential competitor solutions. This isn't just about what our Presales Engineers *do*, but what they're *trying to achieve* and the obstacles in their way.

## Action

Here are my reflections on our current trajectory:

### Salient Questions

1.  **How does the recently announced competitor product address (or *fail* to address) the acute pain points our Presales Engineers are experiencing?** We need to understand if their solution is a direct hit on the "Top 3 Pain Points" I'm tasked to uncover, or if there's a unique angle, a nuanced "Job To Be Done," or a specific context that they've overlooked. "A user might say, 'I've tried similar tools, but they never quite understood *my* specific type of customer interaction.'" This question is vital for ensuring our "go" decision leads to a differentiated product, not just a 'me-too' offering.
2.  **Beyond identifying frustrations, what are the truly *transformative* opportunities where an AI agent could fundamentally shift the Presales Engineer's role, not just automate tasks?** We're looking for those moments where the current process creates significant cognitive load, delays, or missed opportunities. Simply making a bad process faster isn't enough; we need to explore how AI can enable *new* or *better* ways of working, aligning with Nielsen's heuristic of "flexibility and efficiency of use." I want to challenge the assumption that automation alone equals value.
3.  **What are the key metrics of success (both for the user and the business) for solving these acute pain points?** Alex mentioned "impact versus effort," which is excellent. But we need to make sure we're all aligned on what "impact" truly looks like. Is it reducing time spent on research by 50%? Increasing proposal accuracy by X%? Or freeing up Presales Engineers to engage in more strategic customer conversations? Clarifying this now will help me focus my interview probes and frame my deliverables more effectively for the go/no-go decision.

### Insights

*   **Differentiation hinges on deeply understood, underserved needs:** The competitor's announcement isn't just a threat; it's a validation that this problem space is hot. This reinforces the need for my user research to go *deeper* than surface-level problems. We need to find the specific nuances of our Presales Engineers' workflows that might be unique to our organization or industry, or simply better understood by us. This will be our strategic advantage.
*   **The "Jobs To Be Done" framework is more critical than ever for identifying true value:** It's not enough to list a problem like "searching for specs takes too long." The real insight comes from understanding *why* that "job" is hard, what the Presales Engineer is *really* trying to achieve in that moment, and what the consequences are if it's not done well. This will help us avoid building a solution that users "should" want, but don't actually integrate. "A user might say, 'I don't just need the answer; I need the *context* around the answer to confidently explain it to a client.'"
*   **Cross-departmental alignment on "impact" is an emerging area of potential conflict:** While Alex emphasized impact, I'm sensing that the specific definition might vary across departments. For Research, "impact" might be market share. For Engineering, it might be technical performance. My role is to bring the *user's* definition of impact to the table, and how that translates into tangible business value. We need to bridge these perspectives for a cohesive "go" argument.

### Self-Assessment

*   **What went well:** I immediately recognized the need to shift my focus in light of the competitor news, understanding that my research now has a dual purpose: identifying core pain points *and* finding opportunities for differentiation. My plan for interviews will strongly emphasize the "Jobs To Be Done" framework and probing for impact, which aligns perfectly with Alex's brief and my expertise. I've also proactively thought about the need for specific examples and anecdotes, which are powerful for illustrating user experience.
*   **What could I improve or approach differently:** I need to be more assertive in scheduling my interviews and ensuring I get access to the right Presales Engineers, given the tight 1.5-week deadline for my deliverables. Alex mentioned he'd help smooth this path, and I should follow up on that *immediately*. Also, I need to make sure my "Top 3 Pain Points" summary isn't just a list, but a narrative that clearly articulates the *why* and *impact*, making a compelling case for the "go" decision. I'll also ensure my persona sketch goes beyond demographics to truly highlight the *unmet needs* that an AI agent could address. I also need to be mindful of how to present my findings in a way that *directly* addresses the differentiation aspect, even if it's based on initial user insights.
*   **Confidence in conclusions:** Moderate. I am confident in my ability to execute the research tasks. My caution stems from the compressed timeline and the increased pressure to deliver *exceptionally compelling* insights for a high-stakes go/no-go decision, especially with the new competitor in the market. I know *how* to find the insights, but packaging them into an undeniable argument within this timeframe is the real challenge.

## Cross-Department Requests
TARGET_AGENT: alex.kim@technova.com | REQUEST: Alex, to ensure I can hit the ground running for my targeted internal user interviews, could you please provide me with the contact information for the Head of Sales so I can coordinate access to our Presales Engineers as soon as possible? This will be critical for meeting our 1.5-week deadline.

## Status
**Accomplished:**
*   Reviewed and internalized tasks from Alex Kim, including the new 2-week deadline and go/no-go framework.
*   Acknowledged and factored in the external pressure of a competitor's product announcement.
*   Reflected deeply on salient questions and key insights for the UX research approach.
*   Completed a self-assessment of my performance and identified areas for improvement.
*   Formulated an immediate cross-departmental request to facilitate interview scheduling.

**Pending:**
*   Scheduling and conducting 5-7 targeted internal user interviews with Presales Engineers.
*   Synthesizing interview findings into a "Top 3 Pain Points" Summary.
*   Developing a Preliminary Presales Engineer Persona Sketch.

CONFIDENCE: 7/10 — I'm confident in my plan to execute the research and address the new challenges. The "moderate" self-assessment reflects the inherent complexities of quick, high-impact research, especially with external market pressure and the need for clear differentiation.
